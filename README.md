# CRC_HARDWARE_IMPLEMENTATION

Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error detection code commonly used in digital networks 
and storage devices to detect random changes to digital data. Data blocks entering these 
systems are assigned a short check value, based on the remainder of the polynomial division on 
their contents. On recovery, the calculation is repeated, and if the check values do not match, 
corrective action can be taken for data corruption.


## Features

- CRC can be used to correct errors.
- Easy to analyze mathematically.
- good at detecting common errors caused by noise in transmission channels.
